# What I have learned so far

## Terminal

The terminal is what we use to utilize Git, cloning repositories locally, committing changes to the code, and then finally pushing it back up to the remote repository, hosted on sites such as GitHub.

## Git and GitHub

Git is a version control system, meaning that for if whatever reason you need to go back to previous versions of the code.

GitHub is a remote repository, where you can push changes from your local computer to GitHub for everyone else in your team to see.

These two tools seem to be very important for any developer. In case something breaks, you can roll back the code to a version where it was working, and retrace your steps to see what went wrong. Another use case for Git and GitHub is a new hire, who needs to see the history of the code and ask questions to the people who wrote it.
